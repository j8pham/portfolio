## 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my design portfolio repo! This is where I keep all the work I’m proud of — from UX case studies to product concepts, prototypes, and the random ideas that kept me up at 2AM (the best ones always do).

If you’re poking around, you’ll find the code and structure behind my actual portfolio site. The design work itself lives on the site, but the process, structure, and fun bits live here.

## 🌟 What You’ll Find

- Fully responsive portfolio built with HTML / CSS / JS.
- My UX/UI design case studies — research, flows, wireframes, final designs.
- Branding, visuals, and the creative decisions that make the site feel like me.
- A few easter eggs… maybe. 👀

## 📁 Structure

Nothing complicated — just clean, organized files that power the portfolio:
/assets – images, illustrations, logos
/css – styles that keep everything pretty
/js – the sprinkle of interactivity
/pages – each section of the portfolio

If you're a designer checking out my process, or a recruiter checking if I can design and build real stuff… hi 👋 you’re in the right place.

## 🚀 Running It Locally

Since this site uses absolute paths (for GitHub Pages compatibility), you need to run a local server instead of opening files directly.

### Quick Start (Easiest)

**Option 1: Using the provided script**
```bash
./serve.sh
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

**Option 2: Using Python (if installed)**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

**Option 3: Using Node.js (if installed)**
```bash
npm run serve
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

### Why a server?

Absolute paths (`/main.css`) work great on GitHub Pages but require a local HTTP server when developing. This is actually a best practice for web development!

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

I like building experiences that feel:
- Clean and intuitive
- Human, not corporate
- Fun to explore without being cluttered
- Structured enough to scale as I grow
